1.  盈余管理有哪些弊端
2.  盈余管理有哪些优点
3.  解释为什么book-to-market-retio与研发支出是负相关的，假设市场是有效的

优点：
1.  有助于提高企业形象，激励企业经营者，提高企业价值。
2.  有助于企业度过暂时的财务危机。同时，这些做法也提高了股东权益率，企业更容易通过举债方式筹集资金。这样，可以帮助企业度过财务难关，使企业能有充裕的资金进行生产经营活动。
3.  有助于企业减少契约成本。企业管理当局能够通过适当的盈余调整影响契约指标，从而有效地避免再次谈判的成本或技术性违约成本，实现企业价值的最大化。
4.  有助于企业长远发展。对于生产经营状况不稳定的企业，实施利润平滑手段，可以向外界传递出一种生产经营稳定的信息，增强投资者对企业的信心，稳定股价，也有助于股东达到财富最大化目标。
5.  有助于税收筹划目标的实现。适度的盈余管理可以帮助企业合理、合法避税，进行税收筹划。

1.  It is helpful to improve the corporate image, encourage the managers, and improve the corporate value.
2.  It is helpful for enterprises to tide over the financial crisis. At the same time, these laws also improve the ratio of shareholders' equity, which makes it easier for enterprises to collect funds by borrowing.
3.  It can help enterprises reduce contract costs. The enterprise management can influence the contract index through the appropriate earnings adjustment, so as to effectively avoid the cost of renegotiation or technical contract cost, and achieve the maximum value of the enterprise.
4.  For enterprises with unstable production and operation, the implementation of profit smoothing method can transmit a kind of stable production and operation information to the outside world, enhance investors' confidence in the enterprise, stabilize the stock price, and also help shareholders to achieve the goal of wealth maximization.
5.  Help to achieve the goal of tax planning. Appropriate earnings management can help enterprises to tax reasonably and legally, and carry out tax planning.

缺点
1.  降低了财务报表信息的可靠性。当盈余管理超过合理的限度时，就很容易转变为利润操纵，使会计信息失去相关性和可靠性。
2.  对企业的发展具有一定的风险性。公司通过盈余管理增加当期利润后，将使预期目标利润变大。如果下一年度达不到预期目标，可能导致不合法的利润操纵和会计欺诈，最终将破坏投资者对收益质量的信心，导致企业的市场价值下降。
3.  局部利益损害全局利益。一般情况下，盈余管理会促使企业管理水平的提高，但是，不能忽略管理当局为了维护自身的经济利益而损害投资者、债权人和国家的经济利益的事实。
4.  对整个社会资源配置和协调发展不利。从博弈的角度来看，如果竞争对手采取了过度的盈余管理，那么其他企业要保持良好的操守就很难，最终将导致恶性循环和不正常的盈余管理竞争。

1.  It reduces the reliability of financial statements. When earnings management exceeds the reasonable limit, it is easy to turn into profit manipulation, and accounting belief will lose its relevance and reliability.
2.  It has certain risks to the development of enterprises. After the company increases the current profit through earnings management, it will increase the expected target profit. If the expected target is not achieved in the next year, it may lead to illegal profit manipulation and accounting fraud, which will eventually destroy the confidence of investors in the quality of earnings and lead to the decline of the market value of enterprises.
3.  Interests harm the overall interests. General management will promote the improvement of enterprise management level, but we can not ignore the fact that the management authorities in Yi damage the economic interests of investors, creditors and the country in order to safeguard their own economic interests.
4.  Unfavorable to the allocation and coordination of social resources. From the perspective of game theory, if competitors adopt excessive earnings management, it is difficult for other enterprises to maintain good conduct, which will eventually lead to a vicious circle and abnormal earnings management

1.账面市值比(BM)=股东权益/公司市值.
2.股东权益(净资产)=资产总额-负债总额 (每股净资产x流通股数)
3.公司市值=流通股数x每股股价
4.账面市值比(BM)=股东权益/公司市值=(每股净资产x流通股数)/(流通股数x每股股价)=每股净资产/每股股价=B/P=市净率的倒数

账面市值比(BM)通常被用来估计股票价格的便宜程度,BM低的公司一般是股票价格较贵的“成长型”公司，而BM高的公司则是股票价格较为便宜的“价值型”公司。高账面市值比( BM) 的公司股票的未来预期收益会增加，这一现象被称为账面市值比效应。
R&D （research and development），指在科学技术领域，为增加知识总量（包括人类文化和社会知识的总量），以及运用这些知识去创造新的应用进行的系统的创造性的活动，包括基础研究、应用研究、试验发展三类活动。国际上通常采用R&D活动的规模和强度指标反映一国的科技实力和核心竞争力。 一国的R&D水平体现着一国的政治经济实力，一个企业的R&D水平，体现着一个企业的竞争力
Book to market ratio (BM) is usually used to estimate the cheapness of stock price. Companies with low BM are generally "growth" companies with higher stock price, while companies with high BM are "value" companies with lower stock price. High book to market ratio (BM) of the company's stock is expected to increase the future earnings, which is known as the book to market effect.
R &amp; D (Research and development) refers to the systematic and creative activities in the field of science and technology in order to increase the total amount of knowledge (including the total amount of human cultural and social knowledge) and to use these knowledge to create new applications, including basic research, applied research and experimental development. Internationally, the scale and intensity of R &amp; D activities are usually used to reflect a country's scientific and technological strength and core competitiveness. The R &amp; D level of a country reflects the political and economic strength of a country, and the R &amp; D level of an enterprise reflects the competitiveness of an enterprise

在 Ｒ＆D 投入与 BM 效应之间的关系方面，Lev ＆ Sougiannis( 1999) 研究了美国高科技公司 Ｒ＆D 投入强度与投资者对其反应不足的相关性，并指出这种系统性的反应不足来自于投资者对公司 Ｒ＆D 投入预期的不确定性。他们甚至断言 Ｒ＆D 投入强度可以代替 BM 效应来解释高科技上市公司股价 的超额收益。Aboody ＆ Lev( 2000) 认为 Ｒ＆D 投入支出效果评估的困难性是产生上市公司信息不对称的主要原因之一，Chan 等( 2001) 认为对高 Ｒ＆D 投入公司股票价格的扭曲来自于对这类公司无形资产价值的低估。Daniel ＆ Titman( 2006) 也认为 BM 效应产生的原因在于投资者对无形资产的评估而不是有形资产的评估。Kothari 等( 2002) 对美国上市公司样本的研究结果表明，Ｒ＆D 投入带来的利润波动程度是实物投资带来的利润波动程度的三倍。利润现金流的高风险性和Ｒ＆D 投入的低实物资产价值使得 Ｒ＆D 投入对投资者缺乏吸引力
总得来说更低 BM 值的公司往往有更高的 Ｒ＆D 投入强度，更大的市场资本规模，即高 Ｒ＆D 投入 强度的公司股票的 BM 值要相对较小。同时高 BM 值的股票组合不仅有更高的系统风险，而且比低 BM 值股票收益波动程度更高。
In terms of the relationship between R &amp; D investment and BM effect, Lev sougiannis (1999) studied the correlation between R &amp; D investment intensity of American high-tech companies and investors' underreaction to it, and pointed out that this systematic underreaction comes from investors' uncertainty of R &amp; D investment expectation. They even assert that R &amp; D investment intensity can replace BM effect to explain the excess return of high-tech listed companies. Aboody &amp; lev (2000) thinks that the difficulty of evaluating the effect of R &amp; D investment is one of the main reasons for the information asymmetry of listed companies. Chan et al. (2001) thinks that the distortion of the stock price of high R &amp; D investment companies comes from the undervaluation of the value of intangible assets of such companies. Daniel &amp; Titman (2006) also believes that the reason for BM effect lies in investors' evaluation of intangible assets rather than tangible assets. The results of kothari et al. (2002) on the sample of American listed companies show that the degree of profit fluctuation caused by R &amp; D investment is three times of that caused by physical investment. The high risk of profit cash flow and the low value of physical assets of R &amp; D investment make R &amp; D investment less attractive to investors
Generally speaking, companies with lower BM value tend to have higher R &amp; D investment intensity and larger market capital scale, that is, the BM value of stocks of companies with higher R &amp; D investment intensity is relatively small. At the same time, the stock portfolio with high BM value not only has higher systemic risk, but also has higher volatility than the stock portfolio with low BM value.
